## ✅ Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying, check these items:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Contact form submits successfully
- [ ] Blog page loads articles
- [ ] Mobile navigation works on phone
- [ ] Footer appears on all pages

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pages show "404 Not Found"
**Solution**: Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive):
- `homepage.html` (not `Homepage.html`)
- `css/common.css` (not `CSS/Common.css`)

### Problem: Styles not loading
**Solution**: 
1. Check file paths in HTML are correct
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Ensure `css` folder is uploaded

### Problem: JavaScript not working
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure `js` folder is uploaded
3. Check script loading order in HTML

### Problem: Images not showing
**Solution**:
1. Check image URLs in code
2. Ensure external images are accessible
3. Test image URLs in browser

## 📱 Testing Your Site

### Before Going Live:
1. **Test on multiple browsers**:
   - Chrome
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

2. **Test on mobile**:
   - Use browser's mobile view (F12 → Toggle device toolbar)
   - Test on actual mobile device
   - Check mobile navigation

3. **Test all forms**:
   - Submit contact form
   - Subscribe to newsletter
   - Check you receive emails

4. **Test all links**:
   - Click every navigation link
   - Click footer links
   - Check external links open in new tab

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- [ ] Remove any test data or credentials
- [ ] Verify Formspree form ID is yours
- [ ] Check Google Sheets URL is correct
- [ ] Don't commit sensitive data to GitHub

## 🎯 Performance Tips

1. **Optimize images**:
   - Compress images before uploading
   - Use tools like TinyPNG.com
   - Keep images under 200KB when possible

2. **Enable caching** (if using traditional hosting):
   - Add `.htaccess` file with caching rules
   - Consult your hosting documentation

3. **Use a CDN**:
   - External libraries (Font Awesome, PapaParse) already use CDN
   - Consider Cloudflare for additional performance

## 📊 Analytics Setup (Optional)

### Google Analytics:
1. Create account at analytics.google.com
2. Get tracking ID
3. Add to each HTML page before `</head>`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Check the README.md file
2. Look at browser console (F12) for errors
3. Google the specific error message
